Sentry SDK for Flutter
===========

[![build](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-flutter/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-flutter/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

This is a work in progress.
A lot still to be done on [the base SDK](http://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart) before the proper Flutter support is shipped.

## Contributing

The SDK currently supports Android, iOS and Web. We build the example app for these targets in 3 platforms: Windows, macOS and Linux.
This is to make sure you'd be able to contribute to this project if you're using any of these operating systems.

We also run CI against the Flutter `stable` and `beta` channels so you should be able to build it if you're in one of those.

### Dependencies

* Android: Android SDK with NDK: The example project includes C++.
* iOS: You'll need a Mac with xcode installed.
* Web: No additional dependencies.
